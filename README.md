# Boost Components as an External Project:
Minimal example of using Boost Filesystem and Program Options with CMake External Projects.

# Brief Intro:
This minimal example is sufficient for someone trying to use `boost_filesystem` and `boost-program_options` in their project. If Boost filesystem and program_options are installed externally and found by CMake then the Boost is not added as an external project.
